# Laboratory of Computational Physics Mod. B - Exercise Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Laboratory of Computational Physics Mod. B course exercises. This repository contains code and materials related to the analysis of data using machine learning techniques. The primary focus of the first exercise is to analyze signals with N values, where each of the three classes of data represents a signal with the potential addition of a deterministic pattern of length P < N.
This repository is actively maintained, and updates may will be pushed regularly to provide additional exercises.

## Exercises Structure

- **Exercise 1: Signal Analysis with CNNs**
  - First selection of one of two CNNs versions: ending with a Global Max Pooling layer (G) or with a Dense layer (D)
  - Grid search of the validation accuracy over different optimizers with different values of learning rates $\eta$
  - Evaluation of the best regularization parameter $\lambda$
